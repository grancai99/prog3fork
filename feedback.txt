I really enjoyed this project, it was a lot of fun. It applied many of the concepts we are using in class.

In the readme it says:
The dimension n of the screen must be >=0 and <100
The starting location of the turtle must be >0 and <n

I made a 0x0 grid send an error and a turtle starting at (0,0) be valid
